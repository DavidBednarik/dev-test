# Labzone - FE Developer Skill Test

A simple test app to ascertain developer skill-level.

The challenge is to create a basic app using HTML, CSS, JavasScript - React.js and the Flickr API.

The app should demonstate your ability to set up a React App, load in some photos from Flickr (JSON format) [public API](https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json) and display the photo, name and description in a card layout. The images should be clickable and link to the content. The app should have a header and a footer and ideally be responsive.

Bonus points will be awarded for a working search box, loading more photos on scroll and any other visual improvements or animations that you would like to add.

Please fork this repository and create pull request when you are done.

If you do wish to use other Flickr API feeds, be aware that some endpoints do require an API key. You can register for an API key [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/).

More documentation on the API can be found on [this link](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

Pixel perfect mockup to design is a real focus for us at Labzone, the mockup for the test can be found @ https://www.figma.com/file/WnxpAKMFJkzvcrzf4h8vok/Flickr-App (you will need to login to see design details / sidebar)

### Good luck !

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
